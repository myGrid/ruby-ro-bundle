== Synopsis

This is a Ruby library for working with Research Object Bundle files. See the
{Research Object Bundle}[https://w3id.org/bundle/] specification
for more details.

<b>This library is a work in progress!</b> Until we release version 1.0.0 you
can expect the API to change in incompatible ways, although we will try to
keep this to an absolute minimum. Once version 1.0.0 is released we will be
following the principles of {Semantic Versioning}[http://semver.org/] for our
version numbering scheme.

== Usage

Most of this library's API is provided by two underlying gems. Please consult
their documentation in addition to this:

* {zip-container gem}[https://rubygems.org/gems/zip-container]
  {documentation}[http://mygrid.github.io/ruby-zip-container/]
* {ucf gem}[https://rubygems.org/gems/ucf]
  {documentation}[http://mygrid.github.io/ruby-ucf]

There are some examples of how to use the library provided in the bin
directory:

* <tt>ro-bundle-info</tt>: Print out simple metrics about this RO Bundle. This
  is analogous to the standard <tt>zipinfo</tt> command.
* <tt>verify-ro-bundle</tt>: Verify that the specified RO Bundle is valid.
* <tt>dir2ro</tt>: Recursively package up a directory into a RO Bundle. All
  files in the directory are added as aggregates.
* <tt>zip2ro</tt>: Copy all files from a normal zip file into a RO Bundle. All
  files in the zip file are added as aggregates.

See the contents of the tests directory for even more example usage.

== What this library cannot do yet

The {RO Bundle specification}[https://w3id.org/bundle/] is largely
implemented but there are notable gaps at present, including:

* Aggregates do not support ORE proxies yet.
* Extra provenance information cannot yet be added using the <tt>pav:</tt>
  namespace.
* The <tt>@graph</tt> member is not supported in the top-level manifest.
