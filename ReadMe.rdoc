== Synopsis

This is a Ruby library for working with Research Object Bundle files. See the
{Research Object Bundle}[http://wf4ever.github.io/ro/bundle/] specification
for more details.

<b>This library is a work in progress!</b> Until we release version 1.0.0 you
can expect the API to change in incompatible ways, although we will try to
keep this to an absolute minimum. Once version 1.0.0 is released we will be
following the principles of {Semantic Versioning}[http://semver.org/] for our
version numbering scheme.

== Usage

Most of this library's API is provided by two underlying gems. Please consult
their documentation in addition to this:

* {zip-container gem}[https://rubygems.org/gems/zip-container]
  {documentation}[http://mygrid.github.io/ruby-zip-container/]
* {ucf gem}[https://rubygems.org/gems/ucf]
  {documentation}[http://mygrid.github.io/ruby-ucf]

There are some examples of how to use the library provided in the bin
directory. See the contents of the tests directory for even more.
